							<p>Self-driving vehicle technology, also known as autonomous vehicle technology, uses a combination of sensors, cameras, and software to allow a vehicle to drive itself without human intervention. The technology is designed to mimic human driving behavior, allowing the vehicle to perceive its surroundings and make decisions based on that information.</p>

							<p>The sensors and cameras on the vehicle collect data about its environment, including information about other vehicles, pedestrians, road markings, and traffic signals. This data is then processed by the vehicle's onboard computer, which uses algorithms and machine learning to make decisions about how to navigate the vehicle.</p>
								
							<p>The technology behind self-driving vehicles can be broken down into four main categories: perception, localization, mapping, and control. Perception involves the vehicle's ability to perceive its environment using sensors and cameras. Localization involves the vehicle's ability to determine its location on a map. Mapping involves the vehicle's ability to create and update a map of its surroundings. And control involves the vehicle's ability to make decisions about how to navigate its environment based on the information it has collected.</p>
								
							<p>One of the benefits of self-driving vehicle technology is that it has the potential to improve safety on the roads by reducing the number of accidents caused by human error. Additionally, self-driving vehicles could increase mobility for people who are unable to drive due to physical limitations, such as the elderly or disabled.</p>
								
							<p>As self-driving vehicle technology continues to improve, it is expected to become an increasingly common feature in vehicles on the roads. However, there are still challenges to overcome, such as ensuring the technology is safe and reliable, and addressing legal and regulatory issues around autonomous vehicles.</p>
